# ekphrasis
Repo for my bitsy game, [Ekphrasis](https://everyoneisugly.itch.io/ekphrasis).

I created this game as part of the [School of Machines, Making, and Make-Believe'](http://schoolofma.org/)s course on making personal games.

I used [image to bitsy](https://ruin.itch.io/image-to-bitsy) to convert my pixel art into bitsy rooms as well as Sean LeBlanc's [permanent items hack](https://github.com/seleb/bitsy-hacks/blob/master/dist/permanent-items.js).
