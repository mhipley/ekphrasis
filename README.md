# ekphrasis
Repo for my bitsy game, [Ekphrasis](https://everyoneisugly.itch.io/ekphrasis).

I created this game as part of the [School of Machines, Making, and Make-Believe'](http://schoolofma.org/)s course on making personal games.

I used [image to bitsy](https://ruin.itch.io/image-to-bitsy) to convert my pixel art into bitsy rooms as well as Sean LeBlanc's [permanent items hack](https://github.com/seleb/bitsy-hacks/blob/master/dist/permanent-items.js).



### References

The game uses text from [Steve Mitchell's translation](https://poets.org/poem/archaic-torso-apollo) of Rainer Maria Rilke's "Archaic Torso of Apollo."

You can read more about the poem, and check out several other English-language translations [in this article](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/nov/15/apollos-archaic-torso-sarah-stutt).
